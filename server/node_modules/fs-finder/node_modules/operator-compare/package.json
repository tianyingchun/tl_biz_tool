List of available\noperators is bellow.\n\n## Operators\n\nThere are just classic operators with some others.\n\n```\n   Operator   |   Equivalent\n--------------+----------------\n      >       |          >\n      >=      |          >=\n      <       |          <\n      <=      |          <=\n     =, ==    |         ===\n   !, !=, <>  |         !==\n```\n\nLast two lines are sets of operators, so operator `<>` is the same one as `!=`.\n\nIf you will try to set some unknown operator, exception will be thrown.\n\n## Changelog\n\n* 1.1.1\n\t+ Typo in readme\n\n* 1.0.0\n\t+ Initial commit",
